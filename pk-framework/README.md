# PK Framework
This is my own just-for-fun implementation of a modern JavaScript framework. I am inspired by the VueJS syntax and its simplicity, so that is why some parts look very similar to VueJS.

## Goal
The main goals were:
* The super-small size (8kb non-minified, 200 lines of code ðŸš€)
* Pure JavaScript (no dependencies at all)
* Performance is not so important (since it's just-for-fun implementation ðŸ¤—)
* Support of the main concepts of a modern JS frameworks

## Features
The framework supports the following features:
* Value interpolation (`pk-bind`)
* Two-way data binding (`pk-model`)
* Simple loops through array (`pk-for`)
* DOM actions (`pk-onclick`, `pk-onsubmit`, `pk-oncheck`)
* Statements (`pk-if`)
